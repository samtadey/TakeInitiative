# TakeInitiative
The TakeInitiative App is an initiative management tool for dungeon masters(DM's) playing the game of Dungeons and Dragons. It allows DM's to create, manage, and keep track of the encounters that they are running in game. 

DM's can create adventurer's that they are supporting in their game for easy upload into the create encounter process. 

## Adventurers
The adventurer's screen is used to store adventurer's that you want readily available to be pre-loaded during the encounter making process.
